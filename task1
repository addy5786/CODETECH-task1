# Overview Of The Project

Project: INVENTORY MANAGMENT SYSTEM

Objective: The primary goal of the Inventory Management System is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing inventory items, tracking stock levels       and generating reports. 
The system should allow users to add, update, delete, and view inventory items efficiently.

# Architecture

# Frontend:

Tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit for Python that allows for the creation of desktop applications. 
It will be used to create forms, buttons, and other UI elements for user interaction.

# Backend:

Python: The programming language used to implement the business logic of the application. 
It will handle user inputs, interact with the database, and manage the application flow.

# Database:

SQL (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL): A relational database management system to store inventory data.
SQL will be used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the inventory items.

# Features

Inventory Management:

Add new items to the inventory.
Update existing item details (e.g., name, quantity, price).
Delete items from the inventory.
View a list of all inventory items with search and filter options.
Stock Management:

Track stock levels and alert users when items are low in stock.
Generate reports on stock levels, sales, and inventory turnover.
Data Persistence:

Store inventory data in a SQL database to ensure data is retained between sessions.
User -Friendly Interface:

Intuitive GUI for easy navigation and interaction.

Conclusion
An Inventory Management System using Tkinter, Python, and SQL is a practical project that combines various programming concepts and technologies. 
It provides a solid foundation for understanding GUI development, database management, and application design. 
This project can be further expanded with additional features such as reporting, user roles, and integration with other systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms).
